Predicting the speed of a car from a dashcam video.

## Overview
This repository is my attempt at completing comma ai's speed challenge. A full description of the challenge can be found [a here](https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge). I am training and testing multiple models to see which model performs the best. Therefore, I will be updating this repository frequently.
